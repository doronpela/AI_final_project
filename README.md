This is a project which is simply concerned with developing an AI model that predicts whether a product review is positive or negative. 

How to launch the application:

The model 
Product review sentiment analysis
When a review is entered it spits out a prediction and its confidence on a simple web page


Here are the steps below:

1 Install all necessary packages (requirements.txt), 
Flask, tensor flow, keras, nltk, pandas, and pickle. These modules would be instrumental in facilitating the backend on the flask file, integrating the model, preprocessing the input, and delivering the model's prediction and confidence. 

2
In the repo, cd the root directory (the repository) and run this command python3 app.py in your terminal. 

3
To use the app, go to localhost:5000 in your web browser, and the model, along with the HTML file demo will be displayed ready to accept an input review for an arbitrary product. 



Several uses:

1. Customer Insights:
Understanding customer sentiment allows businesses to gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction levels. Identifying positive reviews can highlight what customers appreciate about a product, helping in product enhancement or marketing strategies. Negative reviews can pinpoint areas of improvement, guiding product development and customer service efforts.

2. Product Improvement:
By analyzing negative reviews, businesses can pinpoint specific customer issues or pain points. This feedback can directly inform product development, allowing companies to address shortcomings, fix bugs, or enhance features to meet customer needs and preferences.

3. Brand Reputation Management:
Identifying and responding to negative reviews promptly can mitigate the impact on brand reputation. Addressing customer concerns or issues highlighted in negative reviews demonstrates responsiveness and dedication to customer satisfaction, potentially converting negative experiences into positive ones.

4. Marketing and Sales Strategy:
Identifying positive sentiment can help in crafting effective marketing campaigns. Highlighting positive reviews in marketing materials, leveraging satisfied customer experiences, and understanding what aspects customers appreciate can significantly influence potential buyers' decisions.

5. Competitive Edge:
A model that accurately predicts review sentiment helps in competitive analysis. Understanding how a product is perceived relative to competitors provides an edge in refining strategies, differentiating offerings, and staying ahead in the market.

6. Data-Driven Decision Making:
Having a sentiment analysis model in place enables data-driven decision-making. It allows businesses to quantify customer opinions, track changes in sentiment over time, and make informed decisions based on trends observed in reviews.

7. Customer Engagement and Loyalty:
Responding to reviews, whether positive or negative, shows customers that their opinions matter. Engaging with customers through feedback channels builds trust and loyalty, fostering a sense of community around the brand.

8. Efficient Resource Allocation:
By prioritizing areas for improvement based on sentiment analysis, businesses can allocate resources more efficiently. They can focus on aspects of the product or service that have the most significant impact on customer satisfaction.

In summary, an AI model predicting sentiment from product reviews can be a powerful tool for businesses, offering insights, driving improvements, managing reputation, and enabling data-driven decision-making to enhance customer satisfaction and drive business success.
